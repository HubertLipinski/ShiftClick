# ShiftClick

QOL Inventory mod for Core Keeper. 

This mod provides a better experience when moving items from hotbar to inventory and  vice versa.

## Usage

> Currently only Player's inventory is supported, so ShiftClick won't work with storage chests.

Press `LShift` and click on item you want to move. The selected item will be moved to next available inventory/hotbar slot.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Support for chests
- [ ] Fix equipment slot issues
